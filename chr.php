    <!-- Challenge -->

            <h2 class="center-text">Challenge</h2>
            <p>C.H. Robinson wanted an outside opinion to support an application redesign. The problem my team faced was:

            <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">C.H. Robinson is using an internal application to track development time and help administration accurately plan and allocate resources for future projects. They want to improve accuracy and reduce administration tasks by increasing staffâ€™s participation.</p>

            <p>While being constrained by a limited timeline, C.H. Robinson was available to support our ideas.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Approach -->
    <div class="row full paste">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Approach</h2>
<p>
                My team began by researching tools available on the market, understanding key features, and purpose of the tools. Following this, we went onsite and spoke with current users and administration to reveal pain-points.
                <br>
                <br>
                After synthesizing these findings and addressing how to incorporate them into an interactive prototype; we returned to C.H. Robinson to conduct usability tests. Our team repeated this process multiple times to refine our solution. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Taking the project further we would have addressed other areas that would include administration tools, visual design issues, and terminology.</p>

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="row full crm">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Research and Findings</h2>
            <p>After researching what features are available on the market, we proceeded with a contextual inquiry to identify current users, pain-points, and additional issues with this application. Taking the information, we then hosted a sketch session to allow users to be involved in the design process.</p>
            <div class="col">
                <div>
                    <img class="fit " src="images/chr/whiteboard.jpg" alt="Whiteboarding">
                    <p class="img-desc center-text">User Sketch Session</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We synthesized our data and identified multiple areas that could be improved upon. We found that users wanted features that would enable them to streamline their submission to minimize time spent allocating time.</p>
            <div class="col">
                <div>
                    <img class="fit " src="images/chr/affinity_diagram.jpg" alt="Affinity Diagram">
                    <p class="img-desc center-text">Affinity Diagram</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Users found it difficult to identify which areas to input time, automate their workflow, and visibly see preferred items. These issues caused users to be unhappy and their submissions inaccurate.
            <br>
            <br>
            We took this and created a tool that helps users identify and complete their submissions accurately and efficiently.</p>
