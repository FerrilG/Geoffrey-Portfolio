    <!-- Challenge -->

            <h2 class="center-text">Challenge</h2>
   <p>
                BackpackEMR came to me with multiple problems that fell under a single issue they wanted solved:

                <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">We need a metric module that will allow volunteers, administration, and financial supporters to gauge operational efficiency during and after medical mission trips.</p>

                <p>While being constrained by budget limitations, BackpackEMR was open to all ideas to help them provide users with trip reports.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Approach -->
    <div class="row full paste">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Approach</h2>

                <p>
                After discussing with their CEO to understand BackpackEMR's mission I was able to evaluate other services that provide similar solutions to baseline what a prototype would look like.
                <br>
                <br>
                Delivering these rough wireframes to potential users, doctors and administration, I ranked each feature's impact per user rating and which feature would fit the budget to create a meaningful solution.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taking the project further would include buing a high fidelity prototype to begin usability testing to refine the solution before delivering to the development team to implement.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After gaining an understanding of what their software provides, I was able to compare this to competitors and how they compiled data. This only left me with one problem, <strong>WHAT</strong> do backpackEMR's users want and <strong>WHY</strong> do they felt this way.
            <br>
            <br>
            I built wireframes to show to users so they could evaluate the impact it has allowing me to rank against the development time quote received.</p>

            <p>Once I knew the features that users wanted, I was able to refine my solutions to address the <strong>USERS PROBLEM</strong>.
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">Users found it difficult to evaluate the impact their mission trips had while on-site and at home when following up. Preventing them from successful campaigns for financial support.</p>

        <h2 class="center-text">Proposed Solution</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Now that I knew how users wanted to use the module I could focus on a proposed solution.
            <p style="font-size:1.4rem">Design a module that would export independent metrics so users can reflect upon the daily administration and the campaign as a whole to plan future campaigns accordingly.</p>
            <p>I thought about how I could effectively achieve this and decided to design our inventory tracking and patient status metrics, along with the export feature because they were ranked among the top features that fit within budget.

            <p>Taking my proposed solution, I then created wireframes to visualize what the features would look like. I then built an interactive prototype to test functionality and make sure I addressed both types of users.</p>
