                   <p>PeopleSourced Policy (PSP) wants to create a tool that will educate students and community members on the political budgeting process. PSP provided an existing application, Austin Budget Party, and wanted input on recommendations before they began development.</p>
    <p>My challenge was to send PSP a report that documents what should be altered to help users learn.</p>

        <div class="col crm collapse" id="approach">
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since I was given an existing application, my first step was to evaluate it. I analyzed it based on heuristics specific to its functionality and created a report. I then wanted to know what users thought, so I took this information and designed a script to complete specific actions.</p>
            <p>I used this script to guide moderated usability tests, both in-person and remote to formulate what a working prototype would look like. I documented my findings and created a final report that was delivered to PSP.</p>

        <!-- Heuristic Analysis -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Heuristic Analysis</h5>

        <p>I took the budgeting application and created heuristics similar to Jakob Nielson's to evaluate problem areas. Since there were no instructions for the application, I had to use my best judgement to describe the actions I was performing. I then took my results and created a report to highlight areas that needed improvement.</p>

        <!-- Usability Testing -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Usability Testing</h5>

        <p>Before I built a prototype I wanted to know what users thought of the existing application. I designed a script to moderate users through specific actions to gain critical insight on their thought process and observations. I performed in-person and remote tests to get a diverse set of users. The main thing I wanted to evaluate was if users were able to complete a budget and understand what impact it had.</p>

        <div class="col">
            <h6 class="center-text">Remote</h6>
            <p>Conducted using <strong>Lookback</strong>, a screen sharing tool, I moderated users through my script to gain feedback about the existing application. I found that not being able to control the environment the user was in to be difficult.</p>

        <div class="col">
            <h6 class="center-text">In-Person</h6>
            <p>I rented space at <strong>Fathom Consulting</strong> to carefully examine users in a controlled environment. This enable our team to individually monitor specific characteristics while performing the tasks. </p>

       <!-- Syntheses -->
       <h5 class="center-text">Syntheses</h5>

        <p>I then took my results and compiled them into a spreadsheet to find similarities and overarching themes. This was a daunting task because there were multiple reactions and filtering outliers apart took a long time.</p>

<p>After compiling the data I was then able to construct a report to deliver to PSP on my recommendations. I found that the current application only needed some slight modifications to improve the impact it had on people. Users liked "Austin Budget Party" but felt it had no ground to stand on independently. I recommended that PSP build an objective into their application to set user constraints.</p>
