            <h2 class="center-text">Challenge</h2>
   <p>
   Recreogo had one underlining issue they wanted to address:

                <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">How can I improve business owners and customers experience when processing rental transactions with my service?</p>

                <p>From creating process diagrams to interactive prototypes, Recreogo was open to all forms of feedback that would help retain their current and future clients.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Approach -->
    <div class="row full paste">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Approach</h2>

                <p>
                After evaluating what Recreogo currently provides and documenting issues, I focused my attention towards content layout to improve engagement and functionality of their service.
                <br>
                <br>
                By discussing with business owners, administrative personal, and general research, I was able to design and prototype a solution that provides more information about equipment to business and customer clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                If more time was allowed i would have tested my prototype with Recreogo's clients and evaluated their feedback to make improvements before delivering to Recreogo.

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="row full crm">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text" style="margin-bottom:8%">Research and Findings</h2>
            <p>After spending about an hour with their service, I was able to build a basic understanding of current issues users were having. I had an idea as to why there was a problem, but I didn't have the data to support <strong>WHY</strong> their software left <strong>USERS FELT FRUSTRATED</strong>. I built a diagramed walkthrough of the tasks available and how each action would influence the next. I followed this with a business interview to understand how they use the system and their pain-points.</p>
            <div class="row" style="margin-bottom:4%">

            </div> 
            <div class="col">
            <p>Once I had the research data, I was able to compare with my initial observations to better <strong>DEFINE THE PROBLEM</strong>.
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">Customers had difficulty locating additional information about the available equipment, while business owners were trying to reach customers with limited data fields.</p>

        <div class="col">
        <h2 class="center-text">Proposed Solution</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Now that I had a specific problem, I could define what my solution was.
            <p style="font-size:1.4rem">Create a tool that allows business owners to create equipment listings that are consistent and provide customers with all available information. This tool will allow users to browse content, make educated decisions, and place reservations without needing another touchpoint.</p>
            <p>I thought about how I could effectively achieve this and incorporate what users are already familiar with and the obvious solution was an e-commerce experience.

            <h2 class="center-text">Wireframe Prototype</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Taking my proposed solution, I then created wireframes to visualize what the features would look like. I then built an interactive prototype to test functionality and make sure I addressed both types of users.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Had I been onboard throughout development; I would have observed usability tests with both business owners and customers. I would use this to make future iterations that would guide Recreogo in ways to connect with users.</p>
