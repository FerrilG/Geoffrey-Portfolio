    <!-- Challenge -->

            <h2 class="center-text">Challenge</h2>
   <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.primeacademy.io">Prime Digital Academy</a> is looking for better ways to help prospective students set expectations of what is required and self-assess if the program's curriculum aligns with students expectations. Administration is lean and resources are limited.</p>
   <p>My team's challenge was to create a solution that would require minimal work that would yield greater inquiries, event attendance, and applications.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Approach -->
    <div class="row full paste">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Approach</h2>
            <p>We began by meeting with the administration to gain insight of their application process and statistics. It was then critical to understand other programs and universities teaching the same material to to compare and determine what is unique about Prime.</p>
            <p>Browsing Prime's website was a great way to evaluate what they said and how they said it. Eventually we were led into their marketing efforts on social media.</p>
            <p>Taking all this information we were able to strategize recommendations for how they could approach prospective students. We compiled this in to a report and presented it to the administration team and answered any questions they had.</p>

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="row full lightblu">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Research and Findings</h2>
            <p>To understand what sets Prime apart I needed to know what it offers students that other programs and universities don't. I began by looking into universities offering the same curriculum and found they were graduate programs.</p>
            <p>These programs were averaging $40k-$50k/year for the duration of their study. This then brought me back to Prime, an accelerated immersive program, which is a fraction of that price and offers students the ability to be taught similar material in 18 weeks.</p>
            <p>I then researched Prime's website and noticed the layout was offset, nothing seemed to call to the students. Comparing this to other boot camps nationwide indicated that if they restructured their site it could have an immediate impact.</p>

    <div class="col">
        <h2 class="center-text">Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>Now that we knew what Prime wanted to be, we could formulate a way to get that message out to the public. We brainstormed and discovered four methods that would improve the visibility, message, commitment, and return on applications.</p>
        
        <!-- Social Media - Marketing -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Social Media - Marketing</h5>

        <p>We recommended that Prime use social media to reach a larger audience. It is a low-cost option to yield  visibility. The reason we stressed visibility is because there could be a large number of individuals who want to change industries but don't know how to do so without being in it.</p>
        <p>We suggested a type of campaign called "A Day In the Life" which is based on an Instagram-takeover in which a student posts for a day on everything they are doing. Future students could then relate to those enrolled and envision themselves in the shoes of the student. Gaining perspective on what a student does daily. Additionally this could then be shared and reach a broader audience across multiple platforms.</p>

            <img class="center space" src="images/prime/A_Day_in_the_Life.png" alt="Social Media Storyboard">
        </div>

        <!-- Website - Restructure -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Website - Restructure</h5>

        <p>The current website has all the information that is required, however it was in a format that doesn't keep the reader interested. I informed them that, according to Jakob Nielson, the average page visit is less than a minute before readers move on. I used that to promote a website restructure that would help retain traffic.</p>
        <p>Begin with making readers desire a change. Explain to them what sets Prime apart. Now that they know what Prime is empathize with them and let them know you understand. Follow this up with current or past students to support your empathy. Lastly, let them know how to apply. This structure would help motivate individuals to want to learn more and get in contact with Prime.</p>

            <img class="center space" src="images/prime/Website_Restructure.jpg" alt="Website Restructure">
        </div>

        <!-- Learning Portal -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Learning Portal</h5>
            <p>Prime currently uses a portal for the application process. I also suggested that they utilize this to gather additional metrics on who is using their site. Items that could be on this enhanced portal include a campus calendar, a blog section, links to continued learning, and the ability to ask students questions under the monitoring of student staff.</p>
            <p>Blog posts could include student testimonies, Prime's commitment to students, How Prime builds professional development, and various items</p>
            <p>Continued Learning could circle back to Prime's events or links to help promote learning whether that's through partners or events.</p>
        <div>
            <img class="center space" src="images/prime/Prime_Learning_Portal.png" alt="Website Restructure">
        </div>

        <!-- Application Process -->
        <h5 class="center-text">Application Process</h5>
            <p>We also mentioned that the current method for students to apply was not as effective as it could be. We suggested removing certain parts of their process to allow students to evaluate who they were and determine if Prime would be the best fit for them.</p>

    <!-- Client Presentation -->

        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Client Presentation</h2>
            <p>Taking my proposed solution, I then created wireframes to visualize what the features would look like. I then built an interactive prototype to test functionality and make sure I addressed both types of users.</p>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <div class="row full lightblu">     
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Reflection</h2>
            <p>This project allowed me to critically solve issues that couldn't be immediately measured. I enjoyed presenting to the stakeholders and seeing their excitement before we were done presenting. I feel that our team solved issues that were overlooked and provided multiple solutions that not only solved their goal, but would help propel their long-term goal.</p>
