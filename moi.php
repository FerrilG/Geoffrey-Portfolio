    <!-- Challenge -->

   <p>
                Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute (MOI) came to me looking for a solution to one of the problems they faced:

                <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute (MOI) is relocating to a new building in June 2018 and needs financial support to become sustainable.</p>

                <p>While being constrained by low budget limitations, MOI was open to ideas that would help improve the community involvement.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- Approach -->
    <div class="row full paste">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Approach</h2>

                <p>
                After talking to MOI's executive director, I researched other organizations  to see how they market their services to the community. I built surveys and a prototype of MOI's website to evaluate with community members.
                <br>
                <br>
                I synthesized the results from both and concluded people were confused by the lack of consistency with brand identification.
                <br>
                <br>
                Taking this project further would have included a website re-branding, physical brochures, and surveys to create a stable sense of identification.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Research -->
    <div class="row full crm">
        <div class="col">
            <h2 class="center-text">Research and Findings</h2>
            <p>After gaining an understanding of what their organization provides, I began with a competitive audit to compare against other chapters and how they market themselves, demonstrate impact, and recruit volunteers. Taking the information I gathered I then spoke with current staff members to get their perspective on problem areas that needed to be addressed.
            <br>
            <br>
            I compiled this into a current journey map of the average volunteer learning about MOI.</p>
            
            <div class="col">

                    <p class="img-desc center-text">Current Journey Map</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I now knew <strong>WHAT</strong> areas needed improvements, but this didn't answer <strong>WHY</strong>. Talking to current local volunteers I was able to conclude the <strong>USERS PROBLEMS</strong>.

            
            <p class="center-text" style="font-size:1.4rem">Volunteers found it difficult to identify MOI's brand, the impact their organization has on the community, and the value of it. This prevents them from promoting and supporting MOI</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Solution -->

            <h2 class="center-text">Proposed Solution</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            Now that I knew the specific problem, I could define how to solve this issue.
                <p style="font-size:1.4rem">Create resources to help community members engage and identify, evaluate and support MOI through volunteerism.</p>
