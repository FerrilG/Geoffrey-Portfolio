            <p>Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute (MOI) came to me looking for a solution to one of the problems they faced:</p>
            <p class="center-text">Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute (MOI) is relocating to a new building in June 2018 and needs financial support to become sustainable.</p>
            <p>While being constrained by low budget limitations, MOI was open to ideas that would help improve the community involvement.</p>

    <div class="crm collapse" id="approach">
        <div class="content">
            <p>After talking to MOI's executive director, I researched other organizations  to see how they market their services to the community. I built surveys and a prototype of MOI's website to evaluate with community members.</p>
            <p>I synthesized the results from both and concluded people were confused by the lack of consistency with brand identification.</p>
            <p>Taking this project further would have included a website re-branding, physical brochures, and surveys to create a stable sense of identification.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h5 style="margin-top:5%;">Initial Research</h5>
            <p>I began by talking with MOI's administration to understand what MOI does and what sets them apart. I followed this up by researching other programs nationwide to see how they market themselves, demonstrate their impact, and recruit new volunteers.</p>

            <h5>User Research</h5>
            <p>Taking the information I gathered I then spoke with current staff members to get their perspective on the problem areas that needed to be addressed. I now knew what areas needed improvements, but this didn't answer why. So I went and talked with local volunteers around the metro and I was able to identify user problems.</p>

            <h5>Journey Map</h5>
            <p>Taking the newfound information I built a journey map to visualize how the average volunteer evaluating MOI decides to get involved. The journey starts off rough because of the confusing name and verbage they use.</p>

            <p class="img-desc">Current Journey Map</p>

            <h5>Findings</h5>
            <p>Volunteers found it difficult to identify MOI's brand, the impact their organization has on the community, and the value of it. This prevents them from promoting and supporting MOI.</p>

                <div class="col-7 space">
                    <h6>Awareness</h6>
                    <p>Awareness is how a user learns about the organization and being able to identify it. The current issue users are having is that Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute is a really long and confusing name. For kids this is fun, but for adults they aren't able to identify what the organization does.</p>
                    <p>Since the organization is a reading and writing center, I chose to help spread awareness by providing a tool they could leave with libraries. This way those who enjoy reading can learn about and identify MOI easier</p>

                <div class="col-7 space">
                    <h6>Evaluation</h6>            
                    <p>Evaluation is how a user interprets the organizatiion and being able to relate. Just like with awareness, The name is blocking users from being able to relate to the goal and mission of MOI.</p>
                    <p> The tri-fold will help improve this step as well, but to aid in the evaluation I proposed giving users the ability to fill out a form prior to volunteering. This way users will be able to identify what activities they want to help with and if there are things they cannot do they can address them.</p>
